// Cypress Xpath Plugin

// Important - Please Read - (XPath Plugin Update)
// Hi all,

// Hope all is well.

// In the next Lecture we will use/install a specific plugin, there is a newer version of the XPath Plugin available (Ownership of the plugin has changed).

// Now we will need to use the following Plugin instead: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cypress/xpath

// Please do not run the following command:  npm install --save-dev @cypress-xpath

// Instead use: npm install --save-dev @cypress/xpath

// Inside the e2e.js file (Located inside the support folder), you simply need to add: require('@cypress/xpath');

// Important: You will no longer, need to use/call <reference types="cypress-xpath" /> within your tests.

// The steps listed above will make more sense, as you progress through the next lecture :)

// Cheers,

// Gianni
